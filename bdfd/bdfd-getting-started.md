# BDFD Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
## WE ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH BDFD

We are just a group of people who want to make coding easier! Let's be honest, Some docs don't explain well enough. We are here to fix your suffering and pain!
{% endhint %}

BDFD Is a kinda non-code app & web app for discord bot development, It is called "Bot Designer For Discord". It is on <mark style="color:red;"></mark> [<mark style="color:red;">Apple</mark>](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bot-designer-for-discord/id1495536477), <mark style="color:red;"></mark> [<mark style="color:red;">Android</mark>](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger\&hl=en\_US\&gl=US) & [<mark style="color:red;">Web</mark>](https://botdesignerdiscord.com/app/) <mark style="color:red;"></mark> they have documentation but it can be hard to understand sometimes. [<mark style="color:red;">If you wish to use the BDFD docs you can</mark>](https://nilpointer-software.github.io/bdfd-wiki/).

If you wish to just dive right into coding a bot on BDFD you can view examples & get support from Github Discussions, Discord or check our examples page where users can apply code examples (Community Code examples is coming soon)

## Making a bot application

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may have to regenerate you're token to see it due to Discord changing the way tokens work (To avoid this copy your token when you create your bot & **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE!**)

1. Go to [<mark style="color:red;">Discord Developer Portal</mark>](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<mark style="color:red;"></mark>
2. Click New application, Fill in the details then click the Bot Button
3. On BDFD click the Create New Bot button
4. Go back to the [<mark style="color:red;">developer portal</mark>](https://discord.com/developers/applications) & copy your bot token
5. Go back to BDFD and fill in the details!
6. You can now head to the [<mark style="color:red;">BDFD Examples</mark>](https://megautilitieswiki.herokuapp.com/en/BDFD/Examples) <mark style="color:red;"></mark> or read about each function! (soon)
